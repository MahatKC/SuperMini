#SuperMini

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC), [@spalshzzz](https://github.com/spalshzzz) and [@igorFNegrizoli](https://www.github.com/igorFNegrizoli) in pair programming in 2022.

This project was an assignment for the Operational Systems course we took in our 4th year of Computer Science.

Coded entirely in Python, it implements a filesystem design by ourselves, called SuperMini. [SuperMini's full specification is included](https://github.com/MahatKC/SuperMini/blob/main/Especifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o.pdf). The program allows users to:

<ul>
  <li>Create a new SuperMini image with desired block quantity and size</li>
  <li>Format an existing SuperMini image</li>
  <li>Navigate through a SuperMini image's contents</li>
  <li>Copy a file from the user's disk to the SuperMini image</li>
  <li>Write a file from the SuperMini image to the user's disk</li>
  <li>Create directories in the SuperMini image</li>
</ul>
